This is (going to be) my work blog - one post per working day, saying
what I've done. Almost all of what I do is open source, so I can talk
freely about it - you can look at our latest release, if you like, at
[https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/tpa]. What will go here isn't technical
details or structured thinking or documentation - it's intended to be
just a daily brain dump of that day's work, whatever it's been.
